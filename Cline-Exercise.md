## 🛠️ Exercise Steps

### 1. 🧠 Define Memory Bank

Set up Cline's powerful memory management system:

#### 📚 Memory Bank Setup
- Follow the comprehensive instructions at: [Cline Memory Bank Documentation](https://docs.cline.bot/prompting/cline-memory-bank)
- Configure your project's memory structure
- Define key project contexts and patterns
- Establish documentation standards for persistent knowledge

#### 🎯 Key Benefits
- **Persistent Context**: Maintain project knowledge across sessions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Document recurring patterns and solutions
- **Efficient Onboarding**: Speed up context switching between projects
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Keep important decisions and learnings accessible

### 2. ⚙️ Add Custom Rules

Configure Cline's behavior with custom rules and workflows:

#### 🔧 Rule Configuration
- Use the **"Manage Cline Rules and Workflows"** button in your interface
- Create project-specific automation rules
- Define quality standards and enforcement policies

#### 📋 Example Rule: Unit Test Coverage
**Rule**: *Unit tests with 90% coverage mandatory*

```markdown
- All new code must include comprehensive unit tests
- Minimum 90% code coverage required
- Tests must cover edge cases and error scenarios
- Coverage reports generated automatically
```

#### 💡 Additional Rule Ideas
- **Code Style**: Enforce consistent formatting and naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Require inline comments for complex functions
- **Security**: Mandate security reviews for API endpoints
- **Performance**: Set performance benchmarks for critical paths

### 3. 🏗️ Create a Simple App

Experience Cline's dual-mode development approach:

#### 📝 Phase 1: Plan Mode
- **Strategy Development**: Use Plan Mode to architect your application
- **Requirement Analysis**: Define features, user stories, and technical requirements
- **Design Decisions**: Plan the technology stack and project structure
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies

#### ⚡ Phase 2: Act Mode
- **Implementation**: Switch to Act Mode for hands-on development
- **Code Generation**: Let Cline generate boilerplate and core functionality
- **Iterative Development**: Build features incrementally with AI assistance
- **Testing Integration**: Implement the unit testing rules from step 2

#### 🎨 App Suggestions
- **Todo List Manager**: Classic CRUD application with modern UI
- **Weather Dashboard**: API integration with data visualization
- **Simple Calculator**: Mathematical operations with clean interface
- **Note-Taking App**: Text editing with local storage persistence

### 4. 📄 Document Processing Tasks

Explore Cline's document analysis and generation capabilities:

#### 📖 Document Summarization
- **Upload a Document**: Provide Cline with a text document, PDF, or markdown file
- **Request Summary**: Ask for key points, main themes, and important insights
- **Different Perspectives**: Try requesting summaries for different audiences
- **Length Variations**: Experiment with brief overviews vs. detailed analyses

#### ✅ Checklist Generation
- **Process Documentation**: Convert procedures into actionable checklists
- **Project Planning**: Generate task lists from project descriptions
- **Quality Assurance**: Create review checklists for code and documentation
- **Onboarding**: Develop step-by-step guides for new team members

#### 🎯 Example Requests
```markdown
"Create a deployment checklist from our deployment documentation"
"Summarize this API specification for the frontend team"
"Generate a code review checklist based on our coding standards"
"Convert this meeting transcript into action items"
```
