- **Error Handling**: Robust error messages and validation
- **Progress Reporting**: User feedback during conversion process

#### 🛠️ Technical Requirements
```bash
# Example usage
json-to-csv --input ./data --output ./converted --flatten
json-to-csv -i ./source -o ./dest --max-depth 3
json-to-csv --help
```

#### 📊 Advanced Features to Consider
- **Custom Delimiters**: Support different CSV separators
- **Field Selection**: Allow users to specify which fields to include
